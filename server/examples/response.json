Generate a list of \n  all the necessary electronic components for the project. \n   If there are two possible hardware components, \n  please list ONE. This should be done in a list of JSON objects \n  without special characters. Please also format the JSON in a \n  way that is easy to parse. Please include the brand name, model, \n  type, version, and all other specific information needed to identify \n  this hardware component. (i.e. Arduino Mini Nano V3.0 ATmega328P). \n  Please also include what these components are used for, what\n  the component is, and what are the benefits of using this \n  component. Structure your entire response with this block. \n  Do not include any special characters in the JSON. Do not \n  include any other text or explanations outside of this explanation. \n  Do not include any coordinates, diagrams or additional information\n  outside of these components.\n",
